# chromium_source_tarball

Unofficial all-platform source tarballs for Chromium, unlike the official ones
that you can download from
https://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/chromium-browser-official/, the source
tarballs provided by this project can be used to build on Windows and macOS.

The source tarballs are automatically generated when there is a new release
from the [Chrome Releases](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com) blog.

The source tarballs can be downloaded and built using the
[build_chromium](https://github.com/photoionization/build_chromium) project.
